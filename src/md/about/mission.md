Automation is central when operating and scaling complex systems The more servers and services there are to manage, the harder it gets for a team to fulfill their operational duties without proper automation in place. Automation is a workforce multiplier that helps teams to manage ever growing infrastructure but it can do much more :

* Improve accuracy by being less error-prone than humans
* Increase repeatability by doing tasks in a consistent way
* Improve reliability because it's easier to measure and fix processes once automated
* Save time for more important engineering workforce
* Make processes faster with less room for mistakes
* Enable more safeguards over time in all stages of a process
* Empower users to do otherwise difficult or impossible tasks in a self-service manner
* Accelate deployments for both users and system administrators, with shorter and fewer interruptions
